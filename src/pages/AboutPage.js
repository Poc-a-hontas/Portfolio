                I am striving to work on projects that will allow me to fully use my creativity, push my limits and help me grow. And I am ready to give it my best!
                </p> <br/>
                <p>Making mistakes, breaking rules, setting myself free and having fun while doing it all. Thats creativity to me. Being OK with being an amateur.</p><br/>
                <p>The thing I love the most about being creative is that I can never run out of it. I realised that the more I create, the more creative I get. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                I do realise that my dreams dont work until I do. And so I do; I try and work and I make mistakes. Man, I make mistakes. Until eventually, I master it.
